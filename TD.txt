Updates to your premium
The increased cost of repairs and increased occurrence of severe weather 
and natural disasters in Ontario have affected your premium. Due to 
inflation, the cost of building materials has increased, meaning that the 
cost to repair and rebuild your home in the event of a claim has increased. 
Significant weather events such as ice storms, high winds, and heavy 
rainfall, as well as the increase in frequency and severity of natural 
disasters such as fires and floods have affected the cost of home insurance 
in Ontario.
Visit us online or go to the Insurance Bureau of Canada at ibc.ca for tips on 
protecting your home from the most common types of damage. We also 
invite you to call and speak to one of our advisors and learn ways to save 
on your insurance.

(approved by the Insurance Bureau of Canada)
It is hereby provided and agreed that :
1. Breach of Conditions by Mortgagor, Owner or Occupant
This insurance and every documented renewal thereof as to the interest of the mortgagee only therein 
is and shall be in force notwithstanding any act, neglect, omission or misrepresentation attributable to 
the Mortgagor, Owner or Occupant of the property insured, including transfer of interest, any vacancy 
or non-occupancy, or the occupation of the property for purposes more hazardous than specified in the 
description of the risk; provided always that the Mortgagee shall notify forthwith the Insurer (if known) 
of any vacancy or non- occupancy extending beyond thirty (30) consecutive days, or of any transfer of 
interest or increased hazard that shall come to his knowledge; and that every increase of hazard (not 
permitted by the policy) shall be paid for by the Mortgagee on reasonable demand from the date such 
hazard existed, according to the established scale of rates for the acceptance of such increased 
hazard, during the continuance of this insurance.
2.  Right of Subrogation
Whenever the Insurer pays the Mortgagee any loss award under this policy and claims that – as to the 
Mortgagor or Owner – no liability therefore existed, it shall be legally subrogated to all rights of the 
Mortgagee against the insured; but any subrogation shall be limited to the amount of such loss 
payment and shall be subordinate and subject to the basic right of the Mortgagee to recover the full 
amount of its mortgage equity in priority to the Insurer; or the Insurer may at its option pay the 
Mortgagee all amounts due or to become due under the mortgage or on the security thereof, and shall 
thereupon receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage together with all securities held as 
collateral to the mortgage debt.
3.  Other Insurance
 If there be other valid and collectible insurance upon the property with loss payable to the Mortgagee –  
at law or in equity – then any amount payable thereunder shall be taken into account in determining 
the amount payable to the Mortgagee.
4.  Who May Give Proof of Loss
In the absence of the Insured, or the inability, refusal or neglect of the Insured to give notice of loss or 
deliver the required Proof of Loss under the policy, then the Mortgagee may give the notice upon 
becoming aware of the loss and deliver as soon as practicable the Proof of Loss.
5.  Termination
The term of this Mortgage Clause coincides with the term of the policy;
Provided always that, except for the province of Québec, the Insurer reserves the right to cancel the 
policy as provided by Statutory provision but agrees that the Insurer will neither terminate nor alter the 
policy to the prejudice of the Mortgagee without the notice stipulated in such Statutory provision.
Provided always that in the province of Québec, the Insurer reserves the right to cancel the policy as 
provided by Articles 2477 and 2478 of the Civil Code of Québec, but agrees that the Insurer will neither 
terminate nor alter the policy to the prejudice of Mortgagee without 15 days’ notice to the Mortgagee by 
registered letter.
6.  Foreclosure
Should title or ownership to said property become vested in the Mortgagee and/or assigns as owner or 
purchaser under foreclosure or otherwise, this insurance shall continue until expiry or cancellation for 
the benefit of the said Mortgagee and/or assigns.
Subject to the terms of this mortgage clause (and these shall supersede any policy provisions in conflict 
therewith but only as to the interest of the Mortgagee), loss under the policy is made payable to the Mortgagee.
